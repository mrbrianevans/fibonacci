# Recursive algorithms
#### Java
I have coded two different recursive algorithms to find a given term of the Fibonacci sequence. 
The first is a simple recursion, which results in repeated calculations.
The second stores previously calculated values, making it significantly faster than the first.

This idea was based off the [Fast Exponentiation](https://www.github.com/mrbrianevans/fast-exponentiation "Github repo for Fast Exponentiation") project I did at universtiy.
